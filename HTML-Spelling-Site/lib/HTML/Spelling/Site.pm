=head1 NAME

HTML::Spelling::Site - a system/framework for spell-checking an entire static
HTML site.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<HTML::Spelling::Site::Checker> .

And also see the example code on L<https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage> .

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTML::Spelling::Site was created in order to consolidate and extract the
duplicate functionality for spell checking my web-sites. Currently
documentation is somewhat lacking and the modules could use some extra
automated tests, but I'm anxious to get something out the door.
